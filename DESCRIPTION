Title: A functional interface to use Julia Packages in R
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Stefan Lenz
Maintainer: Stefan Lenz <lenz@imbi.uni-freiburg.de>
Description: This package provides a functionally oriented interface between R and Julia.
    The goal is to use functions from Julia packages directly in R.
    Julia functions imported via the `JuliaConnectoR` can accept and return R variables.
    It is also possible to pass function arguments to enable callbacks from Julia to R.
	The data structures passed to and returned from Julia are serialized to a custom streaming format, 
	sent via TCP and translated to Julia data structures. 
	Returned results are translated back to R. 
	R functions can be passed as arguments and will be invoked by Julia in place of Julia functions.
